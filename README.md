# dictionary-learning

This is a dump of Brian Moore's code and data
from his google drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=12a3pHIQbJxVVuWQEnv1ic42fYzGFvZml

Some directories were renamed by JF to remove spaces and some capital letters.

The original git remote for this data was:
https://github.com/brimoor/dictionary-learning.git
but that URL does not work (or is private).
